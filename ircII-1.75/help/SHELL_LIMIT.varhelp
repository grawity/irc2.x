Usage: SET SHELL_LIMIT_VHELP <value>
  Sets the maximum number of lines of output from any EXEC'd process.
  This is useful to prevent yourself from accidentally starting a process
  with EXEC that spits out soooo much output that everything you know and
  love grinds to a halt.  Setting the to 0 puts no limit on the number
  of output lines from a process.
