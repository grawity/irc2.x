Usage: BIND <key> META2_CHARACTER
  This function switches to an "alternate" keymap.  That is, after
  this character is hit, the next key hit can have a new definition.
  This is how the Escape sequences are done.  In fact, the escape
  key's default binding is META1_CHARACTER.  For example:
    BIND ^X META2_CHARACTER
  binds this function to ^X.  You may then bind meta key sequences
  with either of the two following formats:
    BIND ^X? HELP_CHARACTER
  or
    BIND META2-? HELP_CHARACTER
