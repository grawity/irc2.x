Usage: SERVER <name of server> [port number]
  Switch to the server specified at the specified port number.  If no
  port nunmber is given, the default port number is used.  Your
  channel and AWAY status will remain unchanged.  Occasionally, you
  can switch servers faster than the irc network can send out the
  information that you have left a server.  So don't be suprised if
  it says your nickname is in use...  just wait a moment and set it
  with NICK.
