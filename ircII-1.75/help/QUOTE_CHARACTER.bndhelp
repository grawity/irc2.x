Usage: BIND <key> QUOTE_CHARACTER
  This function "quotes" the next key hit.  What this really means is
  that it overrides the key binding for the next key and forces it to
  insert itself into the input buffer.  For example, if you have
  Control D bound to delete character, and you hit the quote
  character (defaults to Control Q) then Control D, it will insert a
  Control D (shows up as an inverse video D) and does not delete the
  character.  Got it?
