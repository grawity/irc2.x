Usage: SET LASTLOG_MSG_ONLY [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  If LASTLOG_CONVERSATION is ON, and LASTLOG_MSG_ONLY is set to ON,
  then only private messages (/MSG) will be saved in the lastlog.
  If LASTLOG_MSG_ONLY is OFF, all messages are recorded.  If the
  LASTLOG_CONVERSATION variable is set to OFF, then the value of
  LASTLOG_MSG_ONLY is ignored.
