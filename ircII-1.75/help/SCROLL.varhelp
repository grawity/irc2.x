Usage: SET SCROLL [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  Turns ON or OFF screen scrolling.  While OFF, when the cursor reaches
  the bottom of the screen, it jumps to the top and overwrites its way
  back down.  This mode is recommended for *extremely* dumb terminals.
  When ON, the screen will scroll old information off the top.
