Extensions to IRC protocol:

* Wed 20 Feb 11:01:12 1991 WiZ (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

IRC 2.6 has multiple channels, ie. channels beginning with '#'-character.
These channels are specific in the sense that people can join several
of them simultaneusly and take part in several conversations.

IRC 2.6 allows also be started from inetd.
ircd -i specifies that at startup standard input (fd 0) is the port
where this daemon should accept connections from.

IRC 2.6 allows local users to start their own ircds for their private
channels. As the users have complete control of their own ircdaemon,
this provides much more secure way to communicate for people.

* Wed 20 Jun 11:41:19 1990 WiZ (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

IRC daemon under testing in tolsun.oulu.fi has now channels with
string names. The restriction is that the string must begin with
a plus '+' sign.

Example
CHANNEL +Finnish   -joins a channel named 'Finnish'

IRC channels will in future have certain privileges.
Some examples. More suggestions welcome.
p - Private channel. Channel is shown, but it's name is unknown to users
    not in the channel.
s - Secret channel. Channel is invisible to all except people
    in the channel.
m - Moderated channel. Only channel opers can send
    messages to this channel.
a - Anonymous channel. (Not implemented currently due to potential
    problems by abusive users)
o - Operator privilege. Person having this privilege can change
    the mode of the channel.
l - Limited channel. The number of people in this channel is limited.
i - Invite-only channel.

New command:
KICK <channel> <user>
Kicks a user off from certain channel. KICK command may be
used only by channel operators having KICK privilege.

Example:
KICK 42 Kilroy
Throws user Kilroy off from channel 42.

New command:
MODE <channel> <mode>
Change the mode of given channel.

Example:
MODE 42 +m                - Change the channel 42 to be moderated.
MODE 42 -m                - Remove moderation from channel
MODE 42 +l 10             - Change the maximum number of users in
                            channel 42 to be 10
MODE 42 +o WiZ            - Gives channel operator privileges to WiZ
MODE 42 -o WiZ            - Takes channel operator privileges from WiZ

Enhancement on PRIVMSG (works only for OPERs):
  PRIVMSG $<server name mask> <text> sends a private msg to all clients on
                                     servers that match the mask.
  PRIVMSG #<host name mask> <text>   sends a private msg to all clients on
                                     hosts that match the mask.
  Advantage: Easy way to notify ppl in a specific server, host or country
             (*.fi)

Enhancement on K:-Lines in ircd.cf:
  Besides, that it runs now with '*' as username entry ;-):
  Time intervals can be specified in passwd-field, if more than one,
  separated by commas. Then K:-line is only active during these intervals;
  ppl get kicked off if line becomes active even if they're signed on, and
  they will get a warning abaout 5 minutes ago (depends on PING_INTERVAL).
