	* INSTALL

	Modified the installation document as per Valdis's nitpicking.
	Improved the grammer and speling of a lot of dokumentation.
	Removed lots and lots of informal wording, eh? and especially
	the long run on sentences that try to say a lot but really don't
	and are present only to show the author's superiority, especially
	when quoting from a prestigious work like Webster's New Collegiate
	Dictionary, gosh, specifically the 1979 version (ISBN
	0-87779-3580-1), which I guess I should run out and purchase
	immediately, for otherwise I might be considered ignorant by
	wise men who have written a great deal of code in VS/Pascal and
	even IBM Assembler and still can't manage not to avoid including
	.QUIT in every goddam mail message.


	* HISTORY

	Added a recent history of the version numbers and the new
	patchlevel mechanism.


	* BugList

	Added a BugList file including the notation of bug numbers.
