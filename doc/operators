Internet Relay Chat Operator Etiquette Guide

July, 1990.

Welcome! You've either been selected to be an IRC Operator or you have set
up your server and thus have taken on the dual task of IRC Server
Administrator and IRC Operator. Your future days will be filled with hours
of fun chatting on IRC, and then wondering why everyone you talked to went
away, because the links had apparently broken. 

Linking:
========

You will be assigned links from the IRC Routing Coordinators. Please use
these links and these links ONLY. The links have been designed to maximize
efficiency and make delays in chatting minimal. You will be given two
links, one to each regional backbone site. Connect to the primary site
first and then to the secondary site. You should not need to connect to any
other sites. You will be informed if this policy changes.

Kills and Walls:
===============

/kill and /wall are special operator commands. You should use them with
care, and only if absolutely needed. The format are as follows:
/kill USERNAME comment. comment can be a phrase of almost any length
(within reason) and should be used for specifying the reason of the kill.
example: /kill Trillian She's a Ghost
IRC Ghosts are created after a net split has occured and the net has yet to
relink. 

/wall PHRASE. This is used for an emergency command like the net is about
to split into little pieces, and everyone should reconfigure their links
as soon as possible. You will see a WALL when it happens, an operators
nickname will appear with # signs around it.
#Trillian# Server bucse.bu.edu coming down for upgrade. Prepare to
reconfigure links.

/wallops PHRASE This is used to talk to ALL operators at once. It is not
often warranted, but is useful. Often, when there is an important IRC
situation that requires all the operators attention, /wallops is used. The
form for wallops is a nickname with ! signs around it.
!Trillian! Australia should leaf off of eris, not carry all the US traffic.


/TRACE command
/TRACE is useful to know what servers are connected to what. Sometimes
/trace can be confusing, especially you are using it for the first time.
Here is an example of a trace from bucse.bu.edu to beach.cis.ufl.edu:

/TRACE beach.cis.ufl.edu
*** Link bucse.bu.edu<2.5.1.bu.2> ==> beach.cis.ufl.edu
*** Link sirius.ctr.columbia.edu<2.4.1> ==> beach.cis.ufl.edu
*** Link tavi.rice.edu<2.5.1.bu.1> ==> beach.cis.ufl.edu
*** Connection beach.cis.ufl.edu ==> shark.cis.ufl.edu
*** Connection beach.cis.ufl.edu ==> tavi.rice.edu
*** Connection beach.cis.ufl.edu ==> Ra.MsState.Edu

This shows that from bucse.bu.edu (running version 2.5.1.bu.2) to
beach.cis.ufl.edu, routing goes through sirius.ctr.columbia.edu and
tavi.rice.edu before reaching beach. Beach is connected to
shark.cis.ufl.edu and Ra.MsState.Edu, as well as tavi.rice.edu, which is
called its "uplink" because this is where all of the traffic goes up
through. 

/SQUIT command
/squit isolates a specified link from the next closest uplink server. 
For the most part, it should not be used, except in the case of
emergencies. SQUIT is often used to stop all US traffic from routing
through Australia. If minyos is connected to eris and Coombs to betwixt,
then you should SQUIT one of them. Also, if a server is choking, then you
should immediately squit that connection and route around it. 

Please let me know if there should be any additions to this guide. Again,
this is not MANDATORY, this is just a GUIDE. Please conduct yourself as 
an IRC Operator would...you are looked upon for assistance, both emotional
and mental.
