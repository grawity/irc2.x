[ Obsolete Installation file. Read README for new (and far better) document]

NOTE: *READ* this file before installing ircd. 

How to INSTALL irc:

1)  Scan through struct.h for machine dependent parameters and, only
    if absolutely necessary, change the default port to a new one.

2)  Check system type in Makefile

3)  Run make

4)  Read through example irc.conf file and set up your file.
    You can at first just remove all links to other daemons and
    add them when you've tested irc works ok.

5)  Install irc, ircd, irc.conf, irc.1 and ircd.8 in their appropriate places.
    Remember to install ircd as setuid program to a user who can read
    irc.conf-file. irc.conf-file should NOT be readable by everyone.
    If you have set up passwords for irc-client, then you should install
    irc as a setuid program, too.

6)  Check if everything seems to work:
    Start ircd without parameters.
    Start irc
    Now you should be in normal irc-screen, and that means irc and ircd
    have compiled successfully.

7)  If in internet, ask from some (preferably nearest) irc-administrator
    where you should connect your ircd to be able to chat with other hosts
    You should get your authoritative host's domain-name and/or
    internet address. If you do not know any irc-administrator, mail
    a query to irc@tolsun.oulu.fi or irc%tolsun.oulu.fi@tut.fi.
    If you're from states, you can send your queries to
    vijay@lll-winken.llnl.gov

    Then you should get an internet address and port where to connect your
    daemon (in some cases you might get several of them) and two passwords,
    one for other daemon to be able to log into your system and the other
    for your daemon to be able to connect other daemon. Note that you
    always need two passwords, both ends must have a password before
    connection is established ok.

8)  After you have got permission to connect to some other ircd,
    start your ircd. (Remember to kill the previous one if it still is alive).
    You should set irc so that it starts when rc.local is executed, if you
    want to have irc running there all the time. That is; you may want to
    add the following lines to /etc/rc.local (or some equivalent file that
    is executed at system boot time):

    if [ -f /usr/local/bin/ircd ]; then
      /usr/local/bin/ircd & (echo -n ' ircd ') >/dev/console
    fi

    This requires of course that ircd is installed in directory
    /usr/local/bin. 

8)  Check if irc works:
    irc
    When irc-screen appears in front of you, type /links and see, if there
    are other links up. If not, either irc has been started/installed
    unsuccessfully or authoritative host/ircd is down. It is also known
    that daemons may disconnect their links sometimes, so to be sure
    try irc again after a half an hour or so, if it still doesn't show
    other hosts, something is wrong somewhere... 

9)  As a 'normal user' you should know about a couple of things which
    simplify the use of irc a little bit. You can specify an environment
    variable IRCNICK and that will become automatically your nickname
    in irc. Also you can specify environment variable IRCSERVER and that
    is the name of server you want to connect to. Note that these
    variables apply only to clients, they have nothing to do when
    starting ircdaemon (ircd).

If you encounter any bugs or other problems (you sure will have them !),
mail your suggestions and bug reports to me.
