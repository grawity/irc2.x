HISTORY of Recent IRC Versions.


Previous version numbering schemes have caused some confusion, which this
document attempts to resolve.

The original test versions released by WiZ were numbered 2.01?6 where
the ? refers to a letter.  The last known stable version was U6.
Version 2.1.0/1 was rewritten by Mike Bolotski from the U6 sources but 
several bugs were introduced during the rewrite.  After several weeks, 
almost all servers backed up to U6.  Version v6 contained comparatively 
minor modifications from U6.  

Version 2.2 consists of the v6 source repackaged into multiple directories, 
and with modified documentation.  From now on, the version number will
stay relatively constant.  As minor changes and bug fixes are added, they
will be distributed in the form of context diffs, to be applied with the
'patch' command.  Each bugfix will bump the patchlevel (PL) of the release
by 1.  The PL is documented in the version.c file in the lib directory.

Hopefully, whoever provides a fix will also update the respective
ChangeLogs to summarize the changes, as well as adding a description of
the bug to the BugList file.
