.SH NAME
iauth.conf \- The Internet Relay Chat Authentication Configuration File
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIiauth.conf\fP file is read by the \fIiauth\fP program upon startup,
it contains the list of modules that should be used to authenticate a
particular connection.  The list is ordered, which means that the first
module to successfully authenticate a connection will be the last to be
tried.

The file is divided in sections, each section specifies a module with
eventual options using the following format:

.RS
.nf
module\ \fImodule-name\fP
[TAB]option = \fIstring\fP
[TAB]host = \fIhost-name\fP
[TAB]ip = \fIip-address\fP

.fi
.RE
The section ends with an empty line.  The \fImodule-name\fP defines which
module the section applies to.  A particular module may be used in several
sections.  A \fIstring\fP of undefined format may be specified, it will
then be passed to the module upon initialization, see the MODULES section
to find out if a module accepts any option.

If \fIhost-name\fP and \fIip-address\fP fields are specified, then the
module will only be used for connections matching one of the fields given
in the configuration.  If none are specified, then the module will always
be used.

When writing a configuration file, one should \fBalways\fP verify the
syntax using the \fIiauth\fP program to avoid later problems.
.SH MODULES
.TP
.B socks
This module performs a basic check to verify that the host where the
connection originated from doesn't run a proxy server on port 1080 that is
open to the world.  It is useful to reject abusive clients using a relay to
evade kill lines and bans.

This module takes two options:
.B reject
to reject connections originating from a host where an open proxy
was detected,
.B log
to log hostnames where an open proxy is detected.
.TP
.B rfc931
This module is for authentication TCP connections using the protocol
defined in RFC 1413 (which obsoletes RFC 931).
.SH EXAMPLE
The following file will cause the IRC daemon to reject and log all
connections originating from a system where an open proxy is running.  For
all connections, an ident lookup (RFC 1413) will be performed.

.RS
.nf
module socks
        option = log,reject

module rfc931
.fi
.RE

The following file will cause the IRC daemon to only attempt an ident
lookup for connections originating from a host which has an internet
address.

.RS
.nf
module rfc931
        host = *
