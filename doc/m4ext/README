-- README of the ircd.conf m4 extended macro package.... -*- text -*-
$Id: README,v 2.1 1993/11/15 15:24:12 pioch Exp $

A complete new version of the EXTENDED m4 macro package just shipped!!!
These macros allow to write and configure ircd.conf files in a very
simple way, English macros instead of the mysterious Z::*:*:::6667:
cryptic lines...

Version 2.x should be a lot more simple than the 1.x ones since all the
boring uninteresting technical macro code has been moved to another
file, `ircd.m4ext', and the explanations have been moved to a separate
file `m4ext.doc'.

The m4ext-2.x package includes:
              README: this file!
             INSTALL: how to get the thing to work!
           ChangeLog: step-by-step improvements (not really useful)
                NEWS: list of major new features and changes
           m4ext.doc: complete manual, description of macros and arguments.
          ircd.m4ext: the source code of the macros themselves
  example.conf.m4ext: a sample simple ircd.conf template... just fill in!!!

Stop struggling with the number of '::' and ':*:', the setup
of Y class lines, the configuration of Hubs or Leaves, Uplinks or Downlinks!
Have a look at the ircd.conf sample below and see :)


Availability of the package (FTP)
=================================
Release 2.x is available on ftp server ftp.funet.fi, as:
/pub/unix/irc/server/util/m4ext-2.*.tar.gz.

It may be available on other ftp sites or maybe in the next ircd release
if there is enough interest for it.

Important enhancements and changes are in the file 'NEWS'.
Instructions for installation and configuration are in the file 'INSTALL'.
