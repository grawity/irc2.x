---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 2.1 and 2.0

	* example.conf.m4ext: 
ircd.conf has been renamed example.conf.m4ext to match ircd distribution.

	* Makefile: 
New 'make install' to automate file checking and installation.

	* INSTALL, README, NEWS: 
files created.

	* ircd.conf: 
added lines in the template so that unix socket connections are put
in the CLIENT class instead of GUEST.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes between version 1.x and 2.0 of the m4 extended macros:

	* ircd.m4ext: 
New 'GUEST' client class, with limited number of connections
and sendQ. Use this to limit foreign clone bots...

	* ircd.m4ext: 
The SERVER_* macros handle different passwds for C and N lines.
This has been implemented after many requests :)

	* ircd.m4ext, ircd.conf: 
dnl used to remove blank lines output after m4 parsing.
I used it everywhere in ircd.m4ext, but only a couple of times
in ircd.conf because it was going to be unreadable otherwise :)
Left a few # comments so that you can still see them after m4 parsing.

	* ircd.m4ext: 
file created. Ugly m4 macros are now hidden from the public, allowing
neater ircd.conf file. This file must be copied in the ircd.conf dir.
Many defines that need not be changed have been removed from
ircd.conf and moved into ircd.m4ext. The expert user can still
edit ircd.m4ext to change them, though default values should be okay.

	* m4ext.doc: 
file created. Explanations have been moved into this manual file.
