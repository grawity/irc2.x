-- Install of the ircd.conf m4 extended macro package -*- text -*-
$Id: INSTALL,v 2.2 1993/11/15 15:36:11 pioch Exp pioch $

In order to install this package, you simply need to edit `Makefile'
to set up IRCDDIR to the directory where ircd.conf is located
(same as ircd IRCDDIR in Makefile, or DPATH in include/config.h)
then "make install".

You can also type:
	make  IRCDDIR=/where/ircd/directory/is  install

Then you can edit the ircd.conf template supplied
(called example.conf.m4ext) to match your server configuration
so that it suits your needs (don't forget to leave the 2 lines
			# Needed *here* by the package
			include(`ircd.m4ext')dnl
where shown... :)

You can use:
	"m4 ircd.m4 ircd.conf"
		to see if the macros are expanded okay,
	"chkconf"
		to see if this server utility finds any error/mistake.
