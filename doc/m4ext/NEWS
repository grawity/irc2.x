* SERVER_DOWNLINK and SERVER_UPLINK macros now accept different
server passwords for the C and N lines...

Important notice!
For people upgrading from version 1.x, the only incompatibility
is the new Npasswd field in the SERVER_* macros, the arguments of
those macros have been slightly switched! Be careful...

* new client class for 'guests', to limit the effects of clone bots.
