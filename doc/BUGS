The list is probably not as scary as it once was.
Anyone with some free time is welcome to fix those =)

* The server still occasionnally crashes because of some bug
  in the hash tables. (Vesa already fixed this bug several
  times but it keeps crashing :^) [We haven't seen this for ages.]

* localhost (127.0.0.1) resolving is wrong with INET6 enabled

* occasionally we see NJOIN protocol errors (server sends the same NJOIN
  cmd twice somehow)
