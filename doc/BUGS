The list is probably not as scary as it once was.
Anyone with some free time is welcome to fix those =)

* The server still occasionnally crashes because of some bug
  in the hash tables. (Vesa already fixed this bug several
  times but it keeps crashing :^) [We haven't seen this for ages.]

* localhost (127.0.0.1) resolving is wrong with INET6 enabled

* if the same hostname has both A and AAAA (properly set), when client
  connects from either, name/ip is cached and connecting from other
  does not resolve the client

* duplicate dns cache entries can happen

* spoofing hostnames is still possible (res.c rewrite needed to split
  cache in two)
