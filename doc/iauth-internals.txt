		       Internal IAUTH Workings
		       =======================

			     Andrew Snare

Introduction
------------

The iauth daemon was written to offload some aspects of authenticating
incoming ircd connections. Using a modular design, the original
modules provides for identd lookup of incoming connections as well as
checking for open socks proxies.

When the ircd starts up, the iauth process is started as a slave
process. The ircd communicates with the iauth daemon about new
connections, and the iauth slave communicates information back as it
becomes available.

This document has been updated on September 28 2002 to accomodate
changes for ircd release 2.11.

Communication Protocol
----------------------

IRCD Messages:-

The communication protocol used to communicate from ircd to iauth is
line-based and has the following form:

	<id> <category> <information>

	* <id> is used to identify the connection the information
          concerns, and consists of the ircd's file-descriptor for the
	  connection.

	* <category> is a single letter used to denote the type of
          information being sent.

	* <information> is the rest of the line ("\n"-terminated),
	  whose format depends on the category of information.

Categories:

     -	"C"

	Denotes a new connection to start on. The information has the
        form of <remote-ip> <remote-port> <local-ip> <local-port>. Eg:

	2 C 192.168.2.10 13578 192.168.1.1 6667

	This indicates a connection has been received on port 6667
	with local IP-address of 192.167.1.1. The remote IP-address
	was 192.168.2.10 (port 13578).

     -	"O"

	Denotes an update to information about an existing
	connection. The format of this is identical to a C-message (as
	described above).

     -	"D"

	Denotes a client has disconnected. No extra information is
	provided. Eg:

	2 D

     -	"R"

	This denotes a change of identifier for a client. The reason
	for this currently is that sometimes ircd can re-map
	file-descriptors (used as the identifier). The format of the
	information is <new identifier>. Eg:

	2 R 1

	This indicates the client that was on file-descriptor 2 is now
	on file-descriptor 1 (unlikely, I'm sure!:).

     -  "N"

	This denotes information has been received about the hostname
	of a client. Format of the information is <hostname>. Eg:

	2 N host.example.com

	This indicates the hostname of that client is
	host.example.com.

     -  "d"

	This denotes a DNS lookup for the client has timed out or
	failed. This message has no other information. Eg:

	2 d

     -  "A" *

	This denotes a host alias for the connection. Currently this
	message is ignored by iauth and any information discarded.

     -  "U"

        This denotes the username information provided by a
	client. This information cannot be trusted, and is only used
	by ircd when an identd lookup has failed. Format of the
	information is <username>. Eg:

	2 U earthpig

	This indicates the client supplied "earthpig" as the username
	in the USER line during client handshaking with ircd.

     -  "P"

	This denotes password information supplied by the client. Eg:

	2 P uhuh

	This indicates the user supplied a password of "uhuh" during
	client handshaking with ircd. A "U" message will always
	immediately follow this message.

     -  "T"

	This denotes the ircd is registering a client, which will
	usually only occur if iauth has taken too long to get back
	to ircd with a response. This message has no other
	information. Eg:

	2 T

     -	"E" *

	This denotes an error message from ircd. The information
	provided has the form of <error message>. Eg:

	2 E I am a teapot.

     -	"M"

	This denotes an ircd name. The information provided is sent
	only once, at startup, and used in better proxy checks. Eg:

	0 M irc.example.org

IAUTH Messages:

The communication protocol used to communicate from iauth to ircd is
line-based and has the following form:

	<category> <information>

	* <category> is a single letter used to denote the type of
          information being sent.

	* <information> is the rest of the line ("\n"-terminated),
	  whose format depends on the category of information.

     -	">"

        This is used to by iauth to send messages to &AUTH.

     -	"G"

        This is used by iauth to set up debugging feedback from
	ircd. Eg:

	G 1

     -  "O"

	This is used by iauth to tell ircd of some global iauth
	policy decisions. Valid <information> includes the letters
        "R", "T", "A" and "W" only. Eg:

	O RTA

	Valid policy types are:
		R -- All clients _must_ be authenticated by iauth
		     to be allowed through;
		T -- The IRC server should not accept new user
		     connections if iauth hasn't finished its work;
		A -- The IRC server should send additional information
		     to iauth, such as a client-supplied password;
		W -- Extra time should be allowed for requests
		     (usually to allow for hostname information to
		     become available).

     -	"a"

        This indicates that iauth is reading a new configuration
	file. Eg:

	a

     -  "A" *

	This is used to describe the iauth configuration as it is
	read. The information consists of <hosts?> <module name>
	<options>. Eg:

	A * rfc931

	This means that the rfc931 (identd) module is invoked for
	every connection, and no options were given.

     -  "s" *

	This is used to denote that any recorded statistics on iauth
	should be reset. Eg:

	s

     -  "S"

	This is used to send iauth statistics. The information has the
	form of <module name> <module-specific information>. Eg:

	S rfc931 connected 0 unix 0 other 0 bad 0 out of 0

	This indicates some statistics from the rfc931 module.

     -  "U" *

        This is used to send username information (returned by identd)
        to the ircd. This corresponds to information that has been
        deemed usable to ircd by iauth. The information has the form
        of <identifier> <remote IP> <remote port> <username>. Eg:

	U 2 192.168.2.10 13578 earthpig

     -  "u" *

	This is used to send username information (returned by identd)
	to the ircd. This corresponds to information that has been not
	deemed usable to ircd by iauth, usually due to the type of
	reply received from identd. The information has the form of
	<identifier> <remote IP> <remote port> <username>. Eg:

	u 2 192.168.2.10 13578 earthpig

     -  "K"

        This is used to indicate a client should be killed. The
	information provided is of the form <identifier> <remote IP>
	<remote port> :<reason>. Eg:

	K 2 203.36.167.162 13578 :Open proxy found.

     -  "k"

	This is used to indicate a client should be killed. The
	information provided is the same as for the above "K" message
	with the exception that this version is "quieter". ie, The
	ircd won't be as verbose about the client being rejected.

     -  "D"

        This is used to indicate that iauth's processing of a client
	has finished. The information provided is of the form <id>
	<remote IP> <remote port>. Eg:

	D 2 203.36.167.162 13578

     -  "r" *

        This is used by iauth to indicate it is shutting down. No
	extra information is provided. Eg:

	r

Items marked with a * may be incorrect or contain uncertain
information.

Module Processing
-----------------

Module processing is done in a linear manner, one module at a
time. When one module indicates it is finished with the client, iauth
starts the next module on it. However, the matter is complicated
slightly in that multiple passes can be made through the list of
modules. By default each module is given 15 seconds to complete its
work on a given client, before it gets timed-out.

The first pass commences immediately when ircd notifies iauth of a
client to check. A new pass commences:

1) When DNS information about the client's hostname is finalised.

2) When the USER information supplied by the client becomes available.

Earlier versions of iauth did not commence a subsequent pass if DNS
information was not available, but the current version starts one
regardless.

All modules are by default included in the first pass, with unused
modules being included in the second pass if it commences prior to
them being invoked. Modules are deferred to the second pass if they
were configured using the "host = " directive (unless a "ip = " option
was also specified and matched). There is a special case of "host = *"
which forces a module to be delayed until hostname information is
known, where it will always be invoked.

Module Interface
----------------

The default modules are statically linked into the iauth
daemon. However, there are now provisions for dynamically-loadable
modules, as described by the iauth.conf man-page. Regardless of how
they are linked/loaded, modules are currently expected to export the
following functions (and array):

char *name_init(AnInstance *self);
void name_release(AnInstance *self);
void name_stats(AnInstance *self);
int name_start(u_int client);
int name_work(u_int client);
int name_timeout(u_int client);

aModule Module_name =
        { "name", name_init, name_release, name_stats,
          name_start, name_work, name_timeout, name_clean };

By convention the exported symbols use the form "name_symbol" where
"name" is replaced by the module's name. For modules that are linked
statically, a reference to Module_name must be added to the MList
array near the start of conf_read() in a_conf.c

For examples of what the exported functions are expected to do, please 
refer to the (internally documented) modules included in iauth.

Limitations
-----------

Currently iauth suffers from several limitations. It is hoped that in
the future these will be fixed. Patches are welcome. :) These
limitations (in rough order of importance) are:

1) After ircd has registered a client, iauth cannot reject or kill a
connection. It is strongly desired that this be fixed.

2) The current module design assumes a separate TCP/IP connection is
required for each client check (or at least separate file-descriptors
for each client can be watched for activity). While it's possible
tricks could be used to work around this assumption, it has not been
successfully done yet.
