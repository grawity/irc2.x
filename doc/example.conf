# IRC example configuration file
#
# This file describes the information that should be present in your IRC
# configuration and how to present it.
#
# M: set your server's name. Fields are, in order, host name (domain style),
#    unused, a text name, and the port number for it to operate on. The port
#    number should, except in extraordinary circumstances, be 6667
#
M:BUCSD.BU.EDU:*:Boston University Hoopy Test Server:6667
#
# A: administrative information. This line should have three fields, which
#    may contain any arbitrary text. It is printed by the /ADMIN command.
#    Some older versions of IRC have problems handling long fields in this
#    line. You may find that they have been truncated.
#
A:Boston University Computer Science:Boston, MA, USA:Chris Davis <ckd@cs.bu.edu> and Helen Rose <hrose@cs.bu.edu>
#
# I: authorize clients to connect to your server. You can use domains,
#    IP addresses, and asterisk wildcards. The second field can contain a
#    password that the client must use in order to be allowed to connect.
#
#
# Y: define connection class.  These lines define the characteristics for
#    their connections.  All fields MUST be numeric numbers or left null.
#    Class numbers need not be consecutive. eg. for class 1, max of 10 
#    links (auto connects), connectfrequency of 300 seconds, and ping
#    frequency of 90 seconds use:
#
Y:1:90:300:10
I:*.bu.edu::*.bu.edu
I:128.197.*.*::128.197.*.*
I:fenchurch.mit.edu:xyzzy:fenchurch.mit.edu
I:*.harvard.edu::*.harvard.edu
#
# O: authorize operators. Fields are, in order, host name the operator must
#    be logged in from (wildcards allowed), operator's password, operator's
#    nickname. The first example allows me to become an operator from any
#    machine in BU.EDU by typing /oper ckd jolt-cola.
#
O:*.bu.edu:jolt-cola:ckd
O:*.mit.edu:emerald:GEM
#
# U: tell IRC clients what server to connect to. This line can contain
#    a password in the second field, although passwords are rarely (if ever) 
#    used. The fourth field is the port number for the client to connect on.
#    Newer versions of IRC allow you to permanently set the server name by
#    defining UPHOST in config.h.
#
U:bucsd.bu.edu::bucsd.bu.edu:6667
#
# C:, N: set up connections to other servers.
#
# C: specifies a server that your server may connect to.
# N: allows a remote server to connect to your own.
#
# The two lines are almost always given in pairs.
#
# If a C: line contains four fields (the fourth being a TCP port number)
# IRC will actively try to connect to that server. You should have at least
# one such line.
#
# Note that these lines may also contain a password in the second field.
#
# The following two lines tell my server to try connecting to garfield.mit.edu
#
C:garfield.mit.edu::garfield.mit.edu:6667
N:garfield.mit.edu::garfield.mit.edu
#
# The following two lines allow a server to connect to my server, but my
# server will not make any attempt to connect to it.
#
C:helium.elec.ufl.edu::helium.elec.ufl.edu
N:helium.elec.ufl.edu::helium.elec.ufl.edu
#
#
# The following lines tell my server to connect to betwixt.cs.caltech.edu
# But to use the specified password previously set up with Thumper!

# All users on tuminfo3 cannot connect to server during
# 9 am and 12 am, and 2 pm till 5 pm.

# Restrict lines
#
# An extended form of K line.  These look for a match and run an outside
# program to whose reply determines whether the person should be let on.
# R:<host>:program:username
# It is a good idea to use a full path name for the program.  Depending on
# the system, it might follow the instigator's path or accept ~ and such, 
# but there are no guarantees.
# The output of the program should be of the form
# 'Y <message>' to let the user in, or 
# 'N <message>' to keep them out.  In the case of 'N' the message is sent 
# as an error message to the user.  In the case of 'Y' it is ignored.
#
# The following example means hrose@cs.bu.edu can only get in if the
# program /other/irc/bin/arbitrary does not return an 'N'.
R:cs.bu.edu:/other/irc/bin/arbitrary:hrose
#
# Quarantine lines. These lines disallow connections to the 
# specified server and drops the link to anyone connecting to them.
