IRC was conceived of and written by Jarkko Oikarinen <jto@tolsun.oulu.fi>.
IRC was originally written in University of Oulu, Computing Center.
Jun 1990 - IRC 2.5 brought by jto@tolsun.oulu.fi
  - String channels, moderated channels, invite-only channels, etc...

Contributions were made by a cast of dozens, including the following:

Markku Jarvinen <mta@tut.fi>: Emacs-like editing facility for the client

Kimmo Suominen <kim@kannel.lut.fi>: HP-UX port

Jeff Trim <jtrim@orion.cair.du.edu>: enhancements and advice

Vijay Subramaniam <vijay@lll-winken.llnl.gov>: advice and ruthless publicity

Karl Kleinpaste <karl@cis.ohio-state.edu>: user's manual

Greg Lindahl <gl8f@virginia.edu>: AUTOMATON code, the Wumpus GM automaton,
myriad bug fixes

Bill Wisner <wisner@hayes.fai.alaska.edu>: numerous bug fixes and code
enhancements

Tom Davis <conslt16@zeus.unl.edu> and Tim Russell <russell@zeus.unl.edu>:
VMS modifications

Markku Savela <msa@tel4.tel.vtt.fi>: advice and support

The version 2.2 release was coordinated by Mike Bolotski
<mikeb@salmon.ee.ubc.ca>.

The version 2.4 release was coordinated by Markku Savela and
Chelsea Ashley Dyerman

Markku Savela <Markku.Savela@vtt.fi> / April 1990
Fixed various bugs in 2.2PL1 release server (2.2msa.4) and changed
sockets to use non-blocking mode (2.2msa.9). [I have absolutely
nothing to do with clients :-]

Chelsea Ashley Dyerman <chelsea@earth.cchem.berkeley.edu> / April 1990
Rewrote the Makefiles, restructuring of source tree. Added libIrcd.a to
the Makefile macros, numerous reformatting of server text messages, and
added mkversion.sh to keep track of compilation statistics. Numerous
bug fixes and enhancements, and co-coordinator of the 2.4 release.

jarlek@ifi.uio.no added mail functions to irc.

Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de> / May, June 1990:
* Patched KILL-line feature for ircd.conf, works now.
  Enhancement:  Time intervals can be specified in passwd-field.
  Result: KILL-Line is only active during these intervals
* Patched PRIVMSG handling, now OPER can specify masks for sending
  private messages, advantage: msg to all at a specified server or host.
* Little tests on irc 2.5 alpha, fixed some little typos in client code.
  Change: common/debug.c has been moved to ircd/s_debug.c, and a
  irc/c_debug.c has been created, for the benefit that wrong server msg
  are displayed if client does not recognize them. (strange, if a server
  sends an 'unknown command', isn't it?)

Thanks go to those persons not mentioned here who have added their advice,
opinions, and code to IRC.
