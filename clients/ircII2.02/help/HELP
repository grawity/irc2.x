Usage: HELP [command]
  Shows help on the given command.  If no command is specified,
  the list of available commands is displayed.  If an ambiguous
  portion of a command is entered, all matching commands will be
  displayed.  Once the help command is given, you will be put in
  help mode.  In this mode mode, you will be prompted for a help
  topic.  Hitting return without entering a topic will exit help
  mode.  Certain help topics, such as SET, leave you in a help
  sublevel.  Hitting return on these levels brings you one help
  level up.
