Usage: LOAD <filename> [- arg0 arg1 ...]
  Loads the given file into irc, treating each line as an irc
  command, just as if it were typed into the command line.  This
  is the command used automatically at irc startup to load the
  .ircrc file.  If a - is specified after the filename, then each
  line in the loaded file is treated as an alias with parameters
  as given after the - on the command line.
