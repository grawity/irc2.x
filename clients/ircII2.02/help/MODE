    s           - channel is secret
    p           - channel is private
    l <number>  - channel is limited, where <number> is the
                  maximum number of users allowed
    t           - topic limits, only the channel operators may 
                  change it
    a           - channel is anonymous
    o <nick>    - Makes <nick> a channel operator
    i           - channel is invite only
    n           - No MSGs to the channel are allowed
  A + or - sign determines whether the specifies mode should be
  added or deleted.
