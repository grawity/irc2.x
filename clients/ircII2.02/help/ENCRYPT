Usage: ENCRYPT [nickname] [key]
  Given a nickname and a key, this command instructs IRC II to
  encrypt all messages sent to that nickname, and decrypt all
  messages received from that nickname, using the given
  encryption key.  For example, if user CheeseDog wishes to talk
  encryptedly with user DogCheese, they must first agree on an
  encryption key (case sensitive), say foo.  Then user CheeseDog
  must issue a
    ENCRYPT DogCheese foo
  and user DogCheese must issue a 
    ENCRYPT CheeseDog foo
  Thereafter, all messages sent between CheeseDog and DogCheese
  will be encrypted and decrypted automatically.  These messages
  are encrypted/decrypted immediately before being
  sent/displayed, thus anyone who might be "looking" at messages
  as they pass between servers will see on the encrypted version.
  If ENCRYPT is given with a nickname but no key, then encrypted
  conversation is ended with that user.  If ENCRYPT is given with
  no arguments, the list of encrypted user and keys are
  displayed.
