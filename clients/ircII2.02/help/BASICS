Irc is a multi-user, multi-channel chatting network.  It allows
people all over the internet to talk to one another in real-time.
Each irc user has a nickname they use.  All communication with
another user is either by nickname or by the channel that they or
you are on.  All IRCII commands begin with a / character.
Anthing that does not begin with a / is assumed to be a message
that is sent to everyone on your channel.  Here is a list of
basic commands to help you get started:

    /LIST		Lists all current irc channels, number of
			users, and topic.
    /NAMES		Shows the nicknames of all users on each
			channel
    /JOIN <channel>	Join the named channel.  All non-commands
			you type will now go to everyone on that
			channel
    /MSG <nick> <msg>	Sends a private message to the specified
			person.  Only the specified nickname will
			see this message.
    /NICK		Change your nickname
    /QUIT		Exits irc.
    /HELP <topic>	Gets help on all IRCII commands.
    /WHO <channel>	Shows who is on a given channel,
			including nickname, user name and host,
			and realname.
    /WHOIS <nick>	Shows the "true" indentity of someone

These commands should get you started on irc.  Use the /HELP
command to find out more about things on irc, or ask question of
people... most would be happy to help you out.
