Usage: ON [+|-|^]<event> [-|^]<nicknames> [action]
  The ON command lets you set up actions which will occur when
  certains events happen.  For example, you can create
  "personalized" away messages for different individuals.  The
  parameters to the ON command are as follows:

  The <event> parameter may be on of the following: JOIN, LEAVE,
  MAIL, MSG, NOTICE, PUBLIC, WALL, WALLOP, TOPIC, CONNECT,
  CHANNEL_MSG, CHANNEL_NOTICE, TIMER, SEND_MSG, SEND_NOTICE,
  SEND_PUBLIC.
  There are four modes for each of these events.  Different modes
  are specified by preceeding the event with one of the
  following characters:
    +           Make event very noisy.  It will display
                everything it does.
    -           Make event quiet.  It will not display any of
                it's actions.
    ^           Make event silent.  Just like - above except it
                inhibits the normal event display as well.  The
                only command that will cause output in this mode
		is the ECHO command.  This can be used to redefine 
                how event messages look.
  If no character is specifed, you will be warned upon activation 
  of an event.

  The <nicknames> parameter may be a list of comma separated
  nicknames (no spaces allowed in this list).  Any nickname may
  include the wildcard character (*).  The nickname parameter
  determines if the event should cause an action to occur.  If
  the nickname is preceeded by a -, that nickname will be
  removed from the action list for that particular event if no 
  other arguements are specified.  If other arguments are
  specified, then the - is treated as part of the name (this
  is so you can specify negative channel numbers).  If
  the nickname is preceeded by a ^, then no action will be taken
  for that nickname for that event (this is used when you wish
  to exclude a nickname or list of nicknames from a larger
  wildcard match).  The TIMER event is special in that instead
  of taking nicknames as parameters, it takes time
  specifications.  These time specification will be matched
  against the internal clock every minute for a match.  

  The [action] parameter is that action that will occur when the
  specified event occurs as caused by the specified nicknames.
  The action parameter is parsed by the command parse in exactly
  the same way as an IRCII alias is parsed, using the same inline
  variable exapansions (See ALIAS).  Also, depending on the
  event that is activated, there will be certain values passed
  as arguements to the action, just as if they were arguments to
  an alias.  You may use the $0, $1, $2... etc variables to
  expand out these arguments.  The arguments passed for each
  event are described in the individual help files for each event.

  Here are some examples:
    /ON -MSG *cheese* /NOTICE $0 No Cheese Messages Please!
  Whenver a MSG is received from anyone with a nickname with
  cheese in it, a NOTICE will be sent out to that user.  This
  action will generate no noticable effect to you (it is marked
  as "quiet").

    /ON MSG ^BigCheese
  If used with the first example above, this will prevent the
  action from being taken when a message is sent from BigCheese.

  Note:  The way that the variable exapansion works is that is
  you don't use any of the arguments in the text (using the $*,
  $n, $n-m variables), it will automatically append the arguments
  to the end of the string.  To prevent this from happening, use
  the $^ variable anywhere in the action.  This expands to
  nothing but prevents the arguments from being appended to the
  string.

  Another Note:  Your current nickname will not match nicknames
  with wildcards in them. For example, if you do something like:
    /ON TOPIC * /TOPIC This is my topic!$^
  You don't have to worry about the fact that the /TOPIC in the
  action would cause a new action to occur to change the topic
  again... cause it won't.  Your nickname will only match if you
  use it explicity in an ON command.  For example, if your
  nickname was ButHead:
    /ON TOPIC ButHead /TOPIC I am a ButHead.
  This would cause IRCII to get stuck in an infinite loop of
  topic changes.  So don't do it.

  Here is an example of how to redefine the way a
  message looks:
    /ON ^MSG * /ECHO :$0: $1-
  All MSGs received from now on will look:

  :BigCheese: Hello!

  The same can be done with the other event types.

  Lastly, here is an examply of a TIMER use:
    /ON ^TIMER *:00*,*:30* /echo The time is $0
  This will display the time on the half hour.
