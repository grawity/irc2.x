Usage: ECHO <anything you want>
  This simply displays all of it's arguments.  However, it's not
  that simple.  ECHO will work even if DISPLAY is set to OFF,
  making it useful in your .ircrc file.  Also, ECHO will work in
  the action portion of an ON command in all modes.  This can be
  used to redefine the way messages appear.
