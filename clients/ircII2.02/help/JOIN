Usage:  JOIN [<channel>|-INVITE|-NICK <nickname>]
  Changes your current channel to the channel specified.  If the
  -INVITE switch is used, you will join the channel that you were
  last INVITED to.  Or, if we wish to be grammatically correct,
  you will join the channel to which you were last invited.  If
  the -NICK format is used, you will join the channel that the
  specified nickname is on.  If no parameters are given, your current
  channel is displayed.

  Information about the different channels:
    Channel 0 is the limbo channel.
    Channels 1 thru 999 are public.
    Channels 1000 and up are private channels
    Channels below 0 are private/invisible channels.
    Channels with names may also be used Channel names must 
      begin with + For example, +my_channel.  This only works
      with servers 2.5.1 and beyond.
      See HELP MODE for more about this.
    Channels with names may also begin with a #, such as 
      #mutli.  You can be on more than one # channel at once.
