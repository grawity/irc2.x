Usage: QUERY [nicknames|%n]
  Starts a private conversation with [nicknames].  All text you
  type that would normally be sent to your channel now goes to
  [nicknames] in the form of MSGs.  To cancel a private
  conversation, use QUERY with no arguments.  The %n arguments
  allows you to send the query text to a process number n.  The
  process must have already been started using a previous call
  to EXEC.
