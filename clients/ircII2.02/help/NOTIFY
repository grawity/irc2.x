Usage: NOTIFY [-|+]<nickname> [-|+]<nickname> ...
  Use of this command lets you mark certain nicknames such that
  you will be warned when they signon or off of irc.  When
  someone on your notify list signs on, you will see a message
  "Signon:  <nickname>".  Likewise, when they signoff, you will
  see "Signoff:  <nickname>".  Someone will be shown as signed
  off if they change nicknames as well, so keep this in mind.
  You can modify how the signon and signoff messages are
  displayed using the ON NOTIFY_SIGNON and ON NOTIFY_SIGNOFF
  commands.  Specifying a + before the nickname causes IRCII to
  inform you when that nickname changes channels as well as when
  they sign on and off.  ON NOTIFY_CHANGE handles this even.
  Specifying a - before a nickname will remove notification
  checking for that nickname.  If no parameters are specified,
  the current status of each user on your notify list is
  displayed.
