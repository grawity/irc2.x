The IRCII status line shows some important pieces of information.
It shows your current nickname (with an asterisk next to it if
you have OPER privs), your current channel and QUERY user (if you
are QUERYing anyone), current Insert or Overwrite mode (I or O),
and your AWAY status.

The status line may be customized using certain IRCII variables.
