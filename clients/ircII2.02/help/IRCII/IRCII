IRCII is a termcap based interface to the IRC Network.  All
commands to IRCII begin with a '/' (or whatever your current
CMDCHAR is set to, see HELP SET CMDCHAR).  Any other text you
type on the command line is sent directly to the channel you are
on.

IRCII may be ftped from rvw2.hhs.ri.cmu.edu [128.2.104.65]
