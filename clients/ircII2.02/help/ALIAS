Usage: ALIAS [-][alias] [whatever]
  Creates an alias for [whatever].  You can alias anything you
  could type in...  straight text or commands.  The following
  have special meaning in aliases:
    $*   Expands to the rest of the arguments on the command line.
    $n   Where n is a non-negative number, expands to the nth arg.
    $n-m Where n and m are non-negative numbers, expands to the
         nth thru mth arguments inclusive.
    $n-  Where n is a non-negative number, expands from the nth
         argument to the end of the argument list.
    $-m  Where m is a non-negative number, expands from the
         beginning of the argument list to the mth argument.
         This is the same as $0-m.
    $,   Expands to the nickname of the last person who send you 
         a /MSG
    $.   Expands to the nickname of the last person to whom you 
         sent a /MSG
    $"Prompt"  Will prompt you (using the text between the double 
               quotes) for input which will be replaced in the 
               alias.
    $(<var>)  where <var> is any IRCI variable, expands to the value
              of that variable
    $:   Expands to the nickname of the last person to join your 
         channel
    $;   Expands to the nickname of the last person to send a public
         message to your channel
    $S   Expands to the name of your server
    $Q   Expands to the nickname of the person you are QUERYing.
    $+   Expands to your current channel
    $T   Expands to the 'target' of your input (either a QUERY nick or
         a current channel)
    $N   Expands to your nickname
    $/   Expands to the current value of CMDCHAR.  Useful to have 
         aliases work even when you change CMDCHAR.
    $=   Expands to the name of the channel to which you were last
         INVITED
    $S   Expands to the name of the server you are on
    $^   Expands to nothing but prevents the arguments from  
         automatically being appends on expands ($*, $n, and $-n do
         this as well, except the exand as stated above).
    $$   Expands to $
 
  You may also include a width specifier with any of the above
  forms.  This is done by placing [<width>] after the $.  For
  example:
    $[10]+
  This expand to your current channel, but it will truncate any
  characters beyond 10 in the channel name.  If the channel is
  less than 10 characters, it will be padded on the right with
  blanks.  Specifying a negative width will justify the field on
  the right and pad on the left with blanks.  A width of 0 is
  treated as though no width specifier was used.  You can
  include other aliases expansions in the width specifier field
  as well, such as:
    $[$(CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH)]+
  will expands to your current channel using the current setting
  of CHANNEL_NAME_WIDTH.

  Here are some more examples:
    /ALIAS HELLO /MSG $0 Hello, $0! $1-
  This alias can be used by typing:
    /HELLO BigCheese How are you?
  This would act as though you had typed:
    /MSG BigCheese Hello, BigCheese! How are you?
  ALIAS with just the [alias] argument shows the current alias
  for that word.  ALIAS with no argument shows all current
  aliases.  To remove an alias, use ALIAS -[alias].
