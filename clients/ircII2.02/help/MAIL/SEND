Usage: MAIL [SEND] <passwd+-<FLAGS>> <tonick> <toname@host> <valid time> <msg>
  With SEND you can queue a message in the server, and when the
  recipient signs on/off IRC, change nick or join any channel,
  mail checks for valid messages.  This works even if the sender
  is not on IRC.  See HELP MAIL FLAGS for more info.  Password
  can be up to ten characters long.  If a wildcard is specified,
  no password is set.  See HELP MAIL FLAGS for info about flag
  settings.  Toname can be specified without @host.  Do not use
  wildcards in both tonick and toname if it's no need for it.
  Valid time before the message is automatically removed from the
  queue is specified with hours (or days if a '+' character is
  specified before this timeout.
