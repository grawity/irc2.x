Usage: MAIL [SAVE]
  SAVE saves all messages with the save flag set. Notice that the 
  messages are automatically saved (see HELP MAIL STATS). Each time server is
  restarted, the save file is read and messages are restored. If no users
  are connected to this server when saving, the ID number for each
  message is renumbered.
