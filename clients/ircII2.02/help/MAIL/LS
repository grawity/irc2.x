Usage: MAIL [LS] <passwd+-FLAGS> <tonick> <toname@host> <time> <id>
  Shows tonick/toname/tohost sent from your nick and username
  without the content of the message itself.  If no tonick is
  specified, tonick is set to '*'.  The same is done if no
  toname@host is specified.  Use FLAGS for matching all messages
  which have the specified flags set on or off.  See HELP FLAG
  for more info about flag settings.  Time can be specified on
  the form day.month.year or only day, or day/month, and
  separated with one of the three '.,/' characters.  You can also
  specify -n for n days ago.  Examples:  1.jan-90, 1/1.90, 3,
  3/5, 3.may, -4.  If only '-' and no number is specified valid
  time is set to all days.  The time specified is always the
  local time on your system.
