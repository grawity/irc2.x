Usage: SERVER [<name of server>|<number in server_list>|+|-] [port number]
  Switch to the server specified at the specified port number.
  If no port nunmber is given, the default port number is used.
  Your channel and AWAY status will remain unchanged.
  Occasionally, you can switch servers faster than the irc
  network can send out the information that you have left a
  server.  So don't be suprised if it says your nickname is in
  use...  just wait a moment and set it with NICK.  IRCII
  maintains an internall list of servers you have connected to.
  To see that list, use /SERVER with no arguements.  You may also
  specify one of the servers in the server list by its number in
  the list, by issuing:
    /SERVER <number in list>
  Likewise, you can automatically switch to the next or previous
  server in the server list by doing:
    /SERVER + 
  or 
    /SERVER - 
  to switch to the next and previous server in the list,
  respectively.  Every time to switch to a new server, it get
  added to the server list automatically.  To set up initial
  servers in the server list, you can specify them on the command
  line as such:
    irc <nickname> server1 server2 server3
  Each host may have it's own port number and password specified
  on the command line as well:
    irc <nickname> server1:6667 server2:7000:blah server3::foo
  In this case, server1 will use port 6667, server2 will use port
  7000 with password blah, and server3 will use the default port
  number with password foo.  The -p switch on the command line
  allows you to specify the default port number.  Also, if no
  password is specified and one is needed to connect, you will be
  prompted to endter a password before you can connect.  You can
  also specify the default server list in the IRCSERVER
  environment variable using the same format as above.
