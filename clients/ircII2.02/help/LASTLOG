Usage: LASTLOG [flag] [number of entries|string] [from entry]
  Displays the contents of the lastlog.  This is a list of the
  most recent messages that have appeared on the screen.  LASTLOG
  is useful to redisplay the screen if you inadvertantly do a
  /CLEAR or miss messages for other reasons.  If no arguments are
  given, the entire lastlog is displayed.  If the first argument
  is a number, it determines how many log entries to show.
  Otherwise it is searched for in every lastlog entry.  The
  second argument determines how many lines back to start display
  from.  Thus
    /LASTLOG 4 8
  Shows 4 lines of the lastlog, starting at line 8...  lines 8,
  9, 10, 11 are displayed.  Furthermore:
    /LASTLOG bigcheese
  displays only those lastlog entries that contain the word
  "bigcheese".  

  You can further limit the display of the lastlog by specifing
  one of the following flags:
    -PUBLIC		Normal channel messages
    -MSG		Private messages
    -NOTICE		Notices
    -MAIL		Mail
    -WALL		Walls
    -WALLOP		Wallops
    -CRAP		Anything not included in the other
			categories
  The lastlog will only display messages of the type specified
  by the flag.
