Usage: SOURCE <scriptname>
  Source is an alias to /LOAD files into ircII from a specific
  installation-dependent standard script directory. Usually
  something like /usr/local/lib/ircII/script. Scripts may
  contain ircII-specific command sequences. Some script files
  have HELP-files to explain what they are good for, you can
  choose one of those from the list below now.
