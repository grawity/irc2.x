Usage: /SOURCE CAVERN
  This is to make MUD players feel more comfortable with IRC..
  In fact you can make all IRC'ers live in caverns. This script
  contains several /ON commands to change the representation of
  events on your screen, somehow resulting into something like:

  Erectus invites you to cavern 42
  Sapiens enters cavern 42
  Sapiens says: "grrrr"
  Morphism tells you: "|R --> |R"
  Erectus says: "har har har"
  You tell Morphism: "Aaaaaargh!"
  etc. :-)
