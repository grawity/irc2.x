Usage: /SOURCE ACTION
  Several Multi-User-Dungeon-like aliases are defined here.
  The simple ones (without arguments) are:
	APPLAUD		BOUNCE		BOW		BURP
	CHUCKLE		CLAP		COUGH		CRY
	GASP		GIGGLE		GRIN		GROAN
	LAUGH		MOAN		NOD		PURR
	SCREAM		SHIVER		SHRUG		SIGH
	SING		SMILE		SNAP		SNEEZE
	SNORE		WHISTLE		WIGGLE		WINK

  These require a nickname as argument:
	COMFORT		CUDDLE		DANCE		HUG
	KISS		LOVE		POKE		SHAKE
	SLAP		SPIT		THANK

  You can also make up your own sentences with the /ME command,
  e.g. "/ME is hungry." will send "BigCheese is hungry." if you
  are the big cheese.
  The messages are sent as CHANNEL_NOTICEs, are therefore only
  received by the users on the current channel, and correctly
  displayed only on the screens of those, who use IRCII set up with
  this script.
