Usage: /SOURCE BASICAL
  Basical aliases are defined here, so to make ircII compatible
  to the old irc. Some additional standard aliases are defined:

  /CHOP <nick>	    Make a person channel op of your current channel.
  /K <nick>         Kick person from current channel.
  /MO <modechange>  Make a mode change on the current channel.
  /UNCHOP <nick>    Remove channel operator status from person.

  This script should be sourced from the global ircrc.
