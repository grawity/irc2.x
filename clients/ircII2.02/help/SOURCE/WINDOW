Usage: /SOURCE WINDOW				(Thanx gonzo@uniol!)
  This script contains bindings for Window handling in an EMACS-like
  fashion. After pressing the META2 key (either CTRL-X or TAB) you
  can press one of these:

	2	Open a new window.
	z	Grow the current window by one line.
	^z	Shrink the current window by one line.
	0	Close the current window.
