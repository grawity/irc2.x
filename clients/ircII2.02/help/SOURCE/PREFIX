Usage: /SOURCE PREFIX
  For those who use multiple channels without opening windows
  for each of them. The channel name talk is coming from or going
  to is displayed as prefix to each line.
  Due to weird things happening between 2.5.1 and 2.6 some things
  might look a bit confused, hopefully this will be fixed with
  newer releases of IRCII.
