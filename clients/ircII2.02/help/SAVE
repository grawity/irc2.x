Usage: SAVE [filename]
  This will save all of the settings of IRCII to a file.  It
  saves all of the Key Bindings, Variables, and Aliases (in that
  order) in a format such that they can be loaded into IRCII
  using the LOAD command or the -l switch.  If not filename is
  given, the your default .ircrc file will be used (unless
  changed with the -l switch).
