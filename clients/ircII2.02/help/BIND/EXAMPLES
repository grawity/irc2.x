Here are some examples of the BIND function:
    /BIND ^X META2_CHARACTER
  Makes control X a meta key.
    /BIND ^Xl PARSE_COMMAND /LIST
  Binds the meta sequence control X followed by l to perform a
  /LIST.  This binding is only valid if ^X was previously bound
  to a meta function (as was done in the first example).
    /BIND META1-u BACKWARD_HISTORY
  by default, the escape key is bound to META1_CHARACTER, so this
  binding makes the escape u key sequence show the last command
  history entry.  Note that more than one key may be bound to
  *any* function.
    /BIND ! TYPE_TEXT Bang!
  This binds the !  (exclamation mark) to type the word "Bang!"
  into the input line whenever it is hit.
