Usage: BIND <key> PARSE_COMMAND <string>
  The PARSE_COMMAND function cause the supplied string to be
  executed as though it were typed in.  Anything may be given as
  the executed string:  commands, text, aliases, etc.  This
  function does not disturb the contents of the input buffer and
  is not added to the command history.  You may also include any
  of the special $ sequences available in ALIAS (see HELP ALIAS)
  and they will be expanded before the line is parsed.  The
  sequences that deal with command line arguments ($*, $n, $-n)
  are expanded as though there were no command line arguments.
