  IGNORE [[nick|user@host] [-][message type]
  IGNORE [nick [-|+][message type]

  The first form of IGNORE allows you to specify which type of
  messages you wish to ignore from a user.  The message type
  parameter can be one of the following:
    MSGS            All MSGs received
    NOTICES         All NOTICEs received
    PUBLIC          All normal channel conversation
    INVITES         All INVITEs received
    WALLS           All WALLs received
*    WALLOPS         All WALLOPS received
    MAIL            ALL mail received
    ALL             All of the above message types
    NONE            No message types

  You can ignore by nickname or by specifying a userid@hostname
  format.  Wildcards may be used in all formats.  You can specify
  multiple types of messages to ignore on the command line.
  Preceeding a type with a - indicates removal of ignoring of
  that type of message.  For example:
     IGNORE BigCheese PRIVATE INVITES
  ignores MSGs and INVITES from BigCheese.  
     IGNORE *@*.cmu.edu ALL -WALLS
  ignores all types of messages except WALLS from anyone from
  CMU.  The user@host format is considerable slower than the
  nickname format and doesn't function for PUBLIC messages.

  The second form  allows you to specify nicknames which you
  want highlighted when messages of that type from that nickname
  are received.  For example:
    IGNORE *Cheese* +PRIVATE
  will cause all MSGs from anyone with Cheese in their nickname
  to appear with their nickname highlighted.  
    IGNORE * +WALLS +MAIL
  will highlight all WALLS and MAIL received.

  Both forms of IGNORE use the - to remove ignore attributes,
  and the type NONE will remove the user from the list
  completely.

  Both forms of IGNORE will match against the nickname with the
  most true matching characters.  What this means is if you have:
    IGNORE BigCheese PRIVATE
    IGNORE * +ALL
  Then MSG's from BigCheese will be ignored, and all other types
  of messages from BigCheese will be unaffected.  All messages
  of all types from any other user will be highlighted.
