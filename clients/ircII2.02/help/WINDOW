Usage: WINDOW [<argument> [<argument> <argument> ...]]
  The WINDOW command lets you manipulate multiple "windows" in
  IRCII.  Windows are horizontally divided sections of the
  screen in which different bits of irc information can be
  displayed.  WINDOW lets you create, manipulate, and remove
  such windows.  The <argument> parameter to WINDOW can be one
  of the following:
    NEW            Creates a new window by splitting the current
                   window evenly.  
    KILL           Removes the current window.  This does not
                   remove you from any channel you were on in that
                   window.
    GROW <n>       Increases the size of the current window by n
                   lines.
    SHRINK <n>     Decreases the size of the current window by n
                   lines.
    CHANNEL <c>    Directs all conversation with channel <c> to the
                   current window.  If you are not current on
                   channel <c>, you will join it.  If you are on
                   channel <c> it will be diverted to the current
                   window, possibly removing channel <c> from
                   another window.
    BALANCE        Causes all windows to resize so they are as
                   close as possible to evenly sized.
    SCROLL <f>     Where <f> is ON, OFF, or TOGGLE.  This controls
                   scrolling for the current window.  
    HOLD_MODE <f>  Where <f> is ON, OFF, or TOGGLE.  This
                   controls hold mode for the current window.
    LEVEL <L>      Where <L> is a comma separated list of one of
                   the following: CRAP, PUBLIC, MSG, NOTICE,
                   WALL, WALLOP, MAIL, ALL, or NONE.  This controls 
                   what types of messages will go to the current
                   window.
    LASTLOG_LEVEL <L>  Where <L> is the same as for LEVEL, this
                       controls what types of messages displayed
                       in the current window should be saved to
                       the windows lastlog.
  The <L> parameters for LEVEL and LASTLOG_LEVEL are described
  more fully in SET LASTLOG_LEVEL.

  The settings of the system variables SCROLL and HOLD_MODE are
  used as defaults for new windows created.  Executing a 
  SET SCROLL or SET HOLD_MODE will change the settings for the
  current window as well.

  The "current window" is denoted by "^^^^^^^^^^" in the status
  line for that window.   You can switch the current window by
  activating the key functions PREVIOUS_WINDOW or NEXT_WINDOW.
  These are bound, by default, to ^Xp and ^Xn, respectively.

  Each window can have the conversation of a channel going to
  it, which can be specified by either using WINDOW CHANNEL <c>
  or by executing the JOIN or CHANNEL commands in a window.
  Each window can also have it's own QUERY user.  When QUERYing
  someone in a window, all conversation with that person is
  directed to that window.

  No information is ever lost.  Anything that doesn't otherwise
  have a specific window to go to (because it is a window's
  current channel or QUERY user) will either go to the current
  window, or the window who's LEVEL setting contains an
  appropriate type for that message.  By default, the first
  window created has a LEVEL of ALL, meaning that all messages
  will go to that window unless otherwise specified.  This
  includes all output from NAMES, LIST, WHO, etc.  These things
  fall under the CRAP category for LEVEL.  If you want, for
  example, these messages to go to your current window, you can
  do this in the original window:
    WINDOW LEVEL ALL,-CRAP
  Now, all "crap" will go to your current window, while all
  private messages, walls, wallops, mail, and notices will go to
  the root window.
