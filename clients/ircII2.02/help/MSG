Usage: MSG <nicknames|<channel>|%n|-CHANNEL <nickname>> <text of message>
  Sends a private message to the nicknames or list of nicknames
  specified.  A list of nicknames should by separated by commas
  (no spaces).  Two special case nicknames are defined.  If the
  nickname is "," (a comma), the message is sent to the last
  person who sent you a /MSG.  If the nickname is "."  (a
  period), the message is send to the last person to whom you
  send a message.  

  The second form allows you to specify a channel number or
  channel name to which to send the message.  The message will go
  to everyone on that channel.

  The third form lets you specify a process number to which the
  message will go, where n is the process number.  This works
  just like the EXEC -IN command.  For example:
    MSG %1 Homina homina homina
  will send the text to process 1.  Process 1 must be running
  already using a previous call to EXEC.
    
  The last form is similar to the second except that you can
  specify the channel to send a message to by giving the nickname
  of one to the people on the channel.  IRCII will look up the
  proper channel number or name and send the message.
