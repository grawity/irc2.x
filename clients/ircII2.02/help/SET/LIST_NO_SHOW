Usage: SET LIST_NO_SHOW [number of users]
  Setting this to a positive value will prevent the LIST command
  from showing private channels with no topic with less than
  LIST_NO_SHOW users from being displayed.  Thus, if LIST_NO_SHOW
  is 3, no private channels with 3 or less users will be
  displayed unless they have a topic set.
