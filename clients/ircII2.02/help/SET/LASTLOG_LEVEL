Usage: SET LASTLOG_LEVEL [ALL|NONE|[-]<level> [-]<level> ...]
  The setting of this variable determines which types of
  messages are stored in the lastlog.  If ALL is specified,
  everything that shows up on the screen is saved in the
  lastlog.  If NONE is specified, nothing is saved in the
  lastlog.  The <level> specification can be one of the
  following: 
    PUBLIC	    Channel conversation only
    MSG		    MSGs only
    NOTICE	    NOTICEs only
    WALL	    WALLs only
*    WALLOP         WALLOPs only
    MAIL            MAIL only
    CRAP            Anything not covered by the above categories.
  You can combined these on a command line to make the lastlog
  save just what you want.  Also, by putting a - before any
  level, you remove that one from the list.  For example, if you
  wish to save everything except MAIL and all that CRAP, you
  could do:
    SET LASTLOG_LEVEL ALL -MAIL -CRAP
  which is the same as doing:
-    SET LASTLOG_LEVEL PUBLIC MSG NOTICE WALL
*    SET LASTLOG_LEVEL PUBLIC MSG NOTICE WALL WALLOP
