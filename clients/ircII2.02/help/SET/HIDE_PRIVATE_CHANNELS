Usage: SET HIDE_PRIVATE_CHANNELS [ON|OFF|TOGGLE]
  When ON, your channel number will show up as "Prv" in the
  status line when you are on any negative channel or channel
  greater than 999.  Other channels, including named channels,
  show up as normal.  When OFF, your channel always shows up in
  the status line.
 
  NOTE: This command currently does not work properly for named
  channels and for those whose status is changed with the MODE
  command.
