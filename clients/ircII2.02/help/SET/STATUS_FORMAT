Usage: SET STATUS_FORMAT <format description for status line>
  Setting the variable allows you to alter the appearance of the
  status line.  Certain special characters are recognized in
  this format line and replaced with various bits of status line
  information.  Each of these special characters is preceeded by
  a '%'.  Here is a list of these characters:
       N          Your current nickname.
       C          Your current channel.
       Q          Value of the STATUS_QUERY variable. *
       I          Value of STATUS_INSERT variable. *
       O          Value of STATUS_OVERWRITE variables. *
       A          Value of STATUS_AWAY variable. *
       T          Value of STATUS_CLOCK variable. *
       U          Value of STATUS_USER variable. *
       H          Value of STATUS_HOLD variable. *
       *          Value of STATUS_OPER variable. *
       V          Current IRCII version
       %          Replaced by %
  Those marked with * are only displayed in the status line when
  certain conditions are met.  Please get help on the variables
  mentioned above for specifics about each one.

  For example, the standard default IRCII status line format
  looks like this:

  *** IRCII: /HELP for help  %H%N%*  Channel %C%Q (%I%O) %A%T***

  The %H is replaced by the value of STATUS_HOLD if display
  output is stopped (See SET HOLD_MODE), otherwise nothing is
  displayed.  %N is replaced by your current nickname.  %* is
  replaced buy the value of STATUS_OPER if you have operator
  status.  %C is replaced by your current channel.  %Q is
  replaced by the value of STATUS_QUERY if you are querying
  someone, otherwise nothing is displayed.  %I is replaced by the
  value of STATUS_INSERT if you are in insert mode.  %O is
  replaced by the value of STATUS_OVERWRITE if you are not in
  insert mode.  %A is replaced by the contents of STATUS_AWAY if
  you are away.  %T is replaced by the current time of day of the
