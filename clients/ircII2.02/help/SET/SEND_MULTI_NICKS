  to include all of the names of the recipients in the message.
  For example, if You send this message with SEND_MULTI_NICKS ON:
    /MSG BigCheese,CheeseGuy,CheeseDog Howdy.
  It will appear to the recipients as:

  If SEND_MULTI_NICKS is OFF, these messages appear as normal to
  their recipients.
