Easy,

Just edit config.h for the appropriate settings,
and Makefile to set the locations of BINDIR, SHBINDIR and MANDIR,
and then 'make' to test it out, and 'make install' to install it.

If you are on a sysV machine, edit strings.h too...*sigh*

Each flag setting in config.h is commented, so enjoy :-)

ircwho is lagniappe.  It is a small test program, enjoy it too...:-)


We just found out the other day that the WiZ had changed the format of
the whois structure for his new version.  For this version, we are
providing direct hooks to make the transition.  After this, you are
basically on your own.  Even for this, the hooks are only for
`ircwatch.c'.  You have to modify the awk script in ircwho.sh for the
new version yourself.  Moreover, we are not going to be maintaining
these tools after this.  To accommodate any further changes the WiZ may
contemplate, here's what you need to do,

o Modify the routine `format_whois()' in ircwatch.c.  You basically have
  string manipulation code to extract the nick, user, host and gcos name
  from the whois output given by the server.

o The format_who() coding is trickier, and is done via a scanf() and 
  some simpler manipulations.  You have to change the defines HDR and
  FMT in the `chk_who()' routines in ircwatch.c.

o Modify the awk routines in ircwho.sh (or ircwho, as you would have
  installed it)

Tough luck, and sorry about all this :-(

If you need help, send mail to either of us :-)
