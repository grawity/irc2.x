How to install TkServ
---------------------

Yes, there isn't any configure yet. That's why the compilation on some
machines could be difficult because you may have to include one or two
libraries by hand. I'll try to create a configure file in the future.

Up to now, i've only compiled TkServ on Linux, Solaris and Irix. I hope you
won't get into trouble when trying to compile on another OS. But everyone
should be running Linux anyway. :-)

So here we go:

1. Unpack and untar the archive. (which you might already have done :)
2. RTFM. :->
3. run "./configure" (if you haven't already done so)
3. Edit the tkconf.h file.
4. "make tkserv"

Good luck, Kasi
