ALIS - Advanced List Service
http://aliserv.sourceforge.net/

This service is an alternative to the /LIST command.

Unlike the LIST command ALIS has various search parameters such
as minimum users per channel and searching for specific topics.

The server has to be compiled with USE_SERVICES in config.h
