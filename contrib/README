This directory contains ircd related contributions.  Most of them fall
 in one of the following categories:
	* small side utility
	* code sample
	* service

Each contribution lives in its own directory under contrib/ and has a
README file.  For those who need to be compiled, this can be done in
the same directory as you compiled irc and/or ircd.

If you want to submit a package for this directory, see the RULES file.
