This is an example module for the authentication program (iauth) used by
the IRC server.

* This module demonstrates how a module can access and use the PASS and
  USER information provided by users.  It is *NOT* a finished product.  In
  particular, the actual password validation is not implemented.

* This module also demonstrates how a DSM module should be written.  You'll
  note that it is completely identical to ordinary modules, except for one
  extra function: "passwd_load()"

To be used, this module needs to be compiled from the normal compilation
directory.  It should be linked as a dynamic library.  Methods vary
depending on the compiler and platform.

$ gcc -c -g -I../iauth -I../common -I. ../contrib/mod_passwd/mod_passwd.c
$ ld -Bshareable mod_passwd.o -o mod_passwd.so
$ ls -l mod_passwd.so
-rwxr--r--  1 kalt  staff  26932 Mar 13 17:59 mod_passwd.so
$

To be used by iauth, add the following lines to the iauth.conf file:

      extinfo
      shared passwd /path/to/mod_passwd.so
      module passwd

See iauth.conf(5) for more information on configuring iauth.
