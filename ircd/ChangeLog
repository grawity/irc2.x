	numerous files changed and functions moved around to make
	string channels work...

Sun Jun 17 16:52:39 1990  Armin Gruner (gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

      * s_debug.c
        New created file, common/debug.c has been moved to it because
        now we handle also debug outputs in client code

      * s_conf.c
        Added the prefix character into all reply-strings.
        MSGs never appeared on client site because parse() didn't
        recognize it as a prefix (numeric) message
        Changed the test of time-interval, now a specified interval
        that begins before midnight and ends after should also work

      * s_bsd.c
        Added setdtablesize() for sequents OS Dynix,
        default was 20; allows more socket connections.

	* s_msg.c
	  Added newline removal from the end of string ctime()
	  returns (m_info() and m_stats())
	* s_whowas.c
	  Added newline removal from the end of string ctime()
	  returns (m_whowas())
	* s_conf.f
	  Added close() into init_conf()
	  Was obviously forgotten from there
