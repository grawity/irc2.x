Mon Sep 02 16:27:53 1991  Darren Reed <avalon@coombs.anu.edu.au>
	  (lost previous ChangeLog which had accurate dates of additions
	   for 2.6.2. Following is changes from 2.6.1 to 2.6.2).

	* s_conf.c    - added L-line handling for Leaf Enforcement.
			(Courtesy Wumpus (Greg Lindhal)
		      - added det_I_lines_butfirst to make sure each client
			connection only ever has (at most) 1 I-line attached
			to it.

	* channel.c   - fixed ghost ChanOp problem from earlier versions.
		      - painful ^G mode bug fixed for 2.6.1

	* ircd.c      - some problems with TryConnections fixed.

	* s_bsd.c, ircd.c, s_msg.c
		      - local clients are now stored and referenced with an
			array of pointers. This has a fixed size :/

	* s_msg.c, list.c
		      - client list is now a double linked list.
		      - moved some code to list.c to create addition/deletion
			routines to add/delete client records from the list.

	* list.c      - added NICKNAMEHISTORYLENGTH to replace the 'magic' 200.

	* s_msg.c     - Added following commands:
			USERHOST <nickname> [n.[n.[n.[n.]]]]
			ISON <nickname> [nickname...]

	* hash.c, s_msg.c, channel.c
		      - (finally) added hash tables for nickname, server and
			channel name lookup. Nicknames and servers share the
			same table.

Thu Jul 04 20:31:10 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* s_numeric.c
	  Changed sptr->name to parv[0]; use strtoken() for loop.

Mon Jul 01 20:35:40 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* s_msg.c
	  m_notice(), m_text(), m_privmsg() merged to one function.
	  m_wall() changed. Default is WALL. Should be eliminated
	  anyways in next version.

	* channel.c
	  Changed error msgs when parameters from 'l' are missing.

Sun Jun 30 14:53:42 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

Thu Apr 4  16:01:16 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

      * ircd.c, s_bsd.c
        Fix SIGHUP - SIGHUP to ircd causes a rehash() finally.

      * c_msg.c
        Fix KILL from an OPER - pre19 with wildcard match didn't pro-
        pagate the correct sender. Server kills behind *-domains are
        still unsolved.

Sun Mar 31 08:57:12 1991  Jarkko Oikarinen <jto@tolsun.oulu.fi>

        * WALL placed under #ifdef. Default is no WALL

Sun Mar 24 07:43:00 1991  Jarkko Oikarinen <jto@tolsun.oulu.fi>

        * A couple minor bug fixes.
        * Channel name to ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED and ERR_NOTONCHANNEL.

Sun Mar 17 09:50:12 1991  Jarkko Oikarinen <jto@tolsun.oulu.fi>

        * m_who() numeric RPL_ENDOFWHO (315) for all queries
        * RPL_ENDOFWHOIS (316) reply added
        * RPL_ENDOFWHO (315) and RPL_ENDOFWHOIS (316) return
          the query parameter now as well.
        * RPL_WHOISIDLE (317) returns the idle time of a particular user.
        * RPL_NOTOPIC (331), RPL_TOPIC (332) return channel name as a
          paramater (this has been already added to RPL_CHANNELMODEIS (324))
        * Limited trace (won't show users on a server) available now for
          all users
        * Fix to HuntServer() to make sure loops do not happen.
        * Added new numeric, ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED (482) which replaces
          *all* ERR_NOPRIVILEGES (481) messages where the missing privileges
          were channel operator privileges.
        * KICK to user not existant on irc now generates
          ERR_NOTONCHANNEL (442) error reply.
        * ERR_NOSUCHSERVER (402) returns the server name as a parameter.
        * ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN (404) now returns the channel name you couldn't
          send to.

Mon Feb 25 16:08:51 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* s_msg.c
	  'Fixed' K:-line behaviour of m_user(). Now, the connection
	  is not closed; USER-msg is distributed with K:-line remark, and
	  user isn't introduced locally, so user gets 'You have not registered
	  as a user'.

	* ircd.c
	  SIGHUP generates rehash() now.

Mon Feb 11 18:57:56 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

 	* s_msg.c
	  Fixed m_server(). The domain matching was done against the
	  return value of GetClientName(), but this never matches
	  if the servername differs from the host name, because
	  [real socketname] is added to 'inpath'.

Fri Jan 12 12:34:21 1991  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

        * more ircd options at startup...

Mon Dec 03 13:54:25 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

Wed Nov 28 14:07:11 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* class.c, s_bsd.c (CloseConnection)
	  Fixes from avalon (DEBUG stuff)

Tue Nov 27 11:24:56 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* s_msg.c, s_bsd.c, ircd.c, class.c
	  Isolated the implementation of 'classes' to class.c (by using
	  macros for accessing the structure members) -- we should start
	  using this everywhere -- especially with this linear list of
	  clients!!

	* channel.h (new file)
	  prototyping, 'channel'-misc, try to isolate channel implemen-
	  tation to channel.h and channel.c

Sun Nov 25 16:13:42 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	  Fixed 2.6 MODE_NOPRIVMSG bug

	* Added mkversion.sh into self configuration extraction,
	  now version.c.SH

Sat Nov 10 19:10:33 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* Removed getlongtime() everywhere.

	* s_bsd.c
	  Removed some ULTRIX sidesteps.

	* s_conf.c
	  Changed the return values of find_kill().

	* ircd.c
	  Avalon's cleanup's.
	  Change close() to shutdown() (restart()). 

Wed Oct 31 18:20:00 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	* 2.6:
	  - multichannels
	  - wildcard servers
	  - more fun stuff I don't remember anymore but which should
	    be in documentation...

Sun Oct 21 18:53:02 1990  Christopher Davis (ckd at bucsd)

        * Makefile
          - Added IRCDLIBS and IRCDMODE variables

Wed Jun 20 11:53:00 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	numerous files changed and functions moved around to make
	string channels work...

Sun Jun 17 16:52:39 1990  Armin Gruner (gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

      * s_debug.c
        New created file, common/debug.c has been moved to it because
        now we handle also debug outputs in client code

      * s_conf.c
        Added the prefix character into all reply-strings.
        MSGs never appeared on client site because parse() didn't
        recognize it as a prefix (numeric) message
        Changed the test of time-interval, now a specified interval
        that begins before midnight and ends after should also work

      * s_bsd.c
        Added setdtablesize() for sequents OS Dynix,
        default was 20; allows more socket connections.

Sat May 12 22:50:13 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	* s_msg.c
	  Added newline removal from the end of string ctime()
	  returns (m_info() and m_stats())
	* s_whowas.c
	  Added newline removal from the end of string ctime()
	  returns (m_whowas())
	* s_conf.f
	  Added close() into init_conf()
	  Was obviously forgotten from there

Thu May 10 17:17:13 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

        * whowas.c
          Fixed memcpy and bcopy problems
 
Sat Jan  6 17:36:28 1990  Mike Bolotski  (mikeb at coho.ee.ubc.ca)
