Mon Nov  5 19:32:09 1990  Tom Hopkins  (hoppie at buengf)

	* s_msg.c
	  changed m_rehash to make a call to TryConnections and
	  check_pings immediately after rehash
	* ircd.c
	  rewrote main loop to make it (hopefully) eat less CPU under bad
	  conditions and not do too much under good ones.  made check_pings
	  and TryConnectctions exportable to help keep behavior consistent.
	  check_pings now returns a nexttime, like TryConnections.

        that begins before midnight and ends after should also work
