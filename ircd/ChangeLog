Mon Feb 25 16:08:51 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* s_msg.c
	  'Fixed' K:-line behaviour of m_user(). Now, the connection
	  is not closed; USER-msg is distributed with K:-line remark, and
	  user isn't introduced locally, so user gets 'You have not registered
	  as a user'.

	* ircd.c
	  SIGHUP generates rehash() now.

Mon Feb 11 18:57:56 1991  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

 	* s_msg.c
	  Fixed m_server(). The domain matching was done against the
	  return value of GetClientName(), but this never matches
	  if the servername differs from the host name, because
	  [real socketname] is added to 'inpath'.

Fri Jan 12 12:34:21 1991  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

        * more ircd options at startup...

Mon Dec 03 13:54:25 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* class.c, s_msg.c, s_bsd.c
	  Fixes from Avalon. Sigh.

Wed Nov 28 14:07:11 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* class.c, s_bsd.c (CloseConnection)
	  Fixes from avalon (DEBUG stuff)

Tue Nov 27 11:24:56 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* s_msg.c, s_bsd.c, ircd.c, class.c
	  Isolated the implementation of 'classes' to class.c (by using
	  macros for accessing the structure members) -- we should start
	  using this everywhere -- especially with this linear list of
	  clients!!

	* channel.h (new file)
	  prototyping, 'channel'-misc, try to isolate channel implemen-
	  tation to channel.h and channel.c

Sun Nov 25 16:13:42 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* class.c, class.h
	  New files for class-handling. Applied Avalon's patches.
	  Change some code into more readable one (MIN).

Tue Nov 13 11:44:28 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* s_msg.c
	  Fixed Invite bug.

	* s_bsd.c
	  Fixed overhead of check_access.
	  New function to get qualified (local) domain name: AddLocalDomain()

Mon Nov 12 20:42:44 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* channel.c
	  Fixed 2.6 MODE_NOPRIVMSG bug

	* Added mkversion.sh into self configuration extraction,
	  now version.c.SH

Sat Nov 10 19:10:33 1990  Armin Gruner <gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de>

	* Removed getlongtime() everywhere.

	* s_bsd.c
	  Removed some ULTRIX sidesteps.

	* s_conf.c
	  Changed the return values of find_kill().

	* ircd.c
	  Avalon's cleanup's.
	  Change close() to shutdown() (restart()). 

Wed Oct 31 18:20:00 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	* 2.6:
	  - multichannels
	  - wildcard servers
	  - more fun stuff I don't remember anymore but which should
	    be in documentation...

Sun Oct 21 18:53:02 1990  Christopher Davis (ckd at bucsd)

        * Makefile
          - Added IRCDLIBS and IRCDMODE variables

Wed Jun 20 11:53:00 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	numerous files changed and functions moved around to make
	string channels work...

Sun Jun 17 16:52:39 1990  Armin Gruner (gruner@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

      * s_debug.c
        New created file, common/debug.c has been moved to it because
        now we handle also debug outputs in client code

      * s_conf.c
        Added the prefix character into all reply-strings.
        MSGs never appeared on client site because parse() didn't
        recognize it as a prefix (numeric) message
        Changed the test of time-interval, now a specified interval
        that begins before midnight and ends after should also work

      * s_bsd.c
        Added setdtablesize() for sequents OS Dynix,
        default was 20; allows more socket connections.

Sat May 12 22:50:13 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

	* s_msg.c
	  Added newline removal from the end of string ctime()
	  returns (m_info() and m_stats())
	* s_whowas.c
	  Added newline removal from the end of string ctime()
	  returns (m_whowas())
	* s_conf.f
	  Added close() into init_conf()
	  Was obviously forgotten from there

Thu May 10 17:17:13 1990  Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi)

        * whowas.c
          Fixed memcpy and bcopy problems
 
Sat Jan  6 17:36:28 1990  Mike Bolotski  (mikeb at coho.ee.ubc.ca)

	* date.c

	Added HPUX-specific code since it lacks the timezone() function.
