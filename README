This is the offical 2.4 release of irc. There has been one irc loose
claiming to be version 2.4, but this is the real one.

To install the new server, there is just a few changes to be made.
Edit the Makefile in the root of the source tree *only* if you need
to change the system type. It defaults to BSD as is. Edit the
include/config.h to your hearts content, avoiding going beyond the
warning line, unless you are *absolute* sure you know what you are doing.
If you happen to not take heed to this warning, you may end up with
a server that will not function properly and annoy not only you,
but users all around the world.

To install the new client, cd to appropriate directory (whichever
client you happen to prefer). Read INSTALL is installing ircII, or
check include/config.h if installing old irc client.
