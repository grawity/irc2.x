To install the new server, there is just a few changes to be made.  Edit
the Makefile in the root of the source tree *only* if you need to change
the system type (it defaults to BSD as is) or you are using a Sun with
NIS or YP.  Edit the include/config.h to your hearts content, avoiding
going beyond the warning line, unless you are *absolutely* sure you know
what you are doing.  If you happen to not heed this warning, you may end
up with a server that will not function properly and annoy not only you,
but users all around the world.

Both the original irc client and IRC II can be found in this package (in
the subdirectory clients/). To compile, type either "make irc" or "make
irc2". If you are compiling ircII check the README in the ircII
directory before proceeding.

This version was brought together from several sources by ckd@cs.bu.edu;
please send any bug fixes and suggestions to me.

NOTE: This server does *NOT* have MAIL system installed by default.
      The reason is that it doesn't work with many systems.

This version introduces you string channels, starting with
a plus (+) sign. The first person joining a string channel
claims it's ownership and after that is entitiled to use /mode
command. Ownerships can be given and taken away with
/mode <channel> +o <nickname>  and /mode <channel> -o <nickname>
Other flags are: s - secret, p - private, l - limited, i - inviteonly.
                 m - moderated, n - no private messages to channel,
                 t - topic settable by operator only
New command /KICK <channel> <user> kicks a user off channel.
