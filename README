IRC Distribution  2.2 PL0


The full installation document is in doc/INSTALL.  The site-specific
parameters are in lib/config.h.

There is a file called HISTORY in the doc directory that documents the
recent versions of the IRC release and the new numbering/source code control
system. 

Summary of installation procedure:

1.  Modify the lib/config.h file as appropriate.

2.  Choose the operating system type.  Currently only BSD is supported,
    so this step isn't necessary.  When SysV support is added, you may
    have to change the SYS variable in the Makefile.

3.  Type "make config".  This will install the OS dependent files.

4.  Type "make".  This will create the 'ircd' daemon and the 'irc' client
    in the server and client directories.    
  
5.  Modify the irc.conf file appropriately.  There is an example file
    in the doc directory. 

6.  Install the daemon, the client and the conf file.  A common location is
    in /usr/local/bin for the binaries, and /usr/local/lib for the conf file.


If you are installing IRC for the first time, it is recommended that
you send e-mail to irclist@tolsun.oulu.fi to get on the IRC mailing list.
That address is also useful if you experience any problems during installation.
