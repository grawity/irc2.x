Subject: TODO list
--------
Here's current TODO list for things to do for future versions of IRC:

1) Channel names could be variable length strings. Maybe some maximum
   length but not necessarily. Should there be case signifigance ?

2) Joining a new channel:
   CHANNEL channelname [+|-][#]
   + could be used for private channel,
   - for secret channel
   and # could be used to set maximum number of users allowed in
   this channel only first user could set maximum number of users.
   The default could be 10 or 15.
   This is the protocol suggestion, irc client might have some more
   user-friendly way (is there one ?) to do it.

3) USER command (via /quote USER blaahblaahblaah...) should not be allowed
   after login, unless given by OPERator.

4) INVITE command should respond with AWAY message if user has marked
   himself being away.

5) HPUX porting. I have the diffs, just have been too lazy to insert them.

6) SERVER (protocol command) needs a rewrite. LINKS doesn't contain
   many facts currently. Necessity for administrating ircnet.

7) Some fixes to irc.conf -file and it's handling (/add /delete /rehash,
   minor bug fixes)

8) LISTEN or MONITOR command. Allows one user to be on several channels
   at once, but it is possible to be active in only one channel.
   Or should it be possible to be active on several channels ?
   If so, how to tell to which channel a message is supposed to go ?
   Anyway this brings with the need for LEAVE command.

9) Kill list of offensive users. 

10) SLEEP/WAKEUP commands for less often used servers.

11) .ircrc file and possibility to bind irc commands in irc client
    with /bind command

--Jarkko
